HELP: deploy-word-props?
{ $description "Deploy flag. If set, the deploy tool retains all word properties. Otherwise, it applies various heuristics to strip out un-needed word properties from words in the dictionary."
$nl
"Off by default. Enable this if the heuristics strip out required word properties." } ;

HELP: deploy-word-defs?
{ $description "Deploy flag. If set, the deploy tool retains word definition quotations for words compiled with the optimizing compiler. Otherwise, word definitions are stripped from words compiled with the optimizing compiler."
$nl
"Off by default. During normal execution, the word definition quotation of a word compiled with the optimizing compiler is not used, so disabling this flag can save space. However, some libraries introspect word definitions dynamically (for example, " { $vocab-link "inverse" } ") and so programs using these libraries must retain word definition quotations." } ;

HELP: deploy-c-types?
{ $description "Deploy flag. If set, the deploy tool retains the " { $link c-types } " table, otherwise this table is stripped out, saving space."
$nl
"Off by default."
$nl
"The optimizing compiler is able to fold away calls to various words which take a C type as an input if the C type is a literal string:"

"If your program looks up C types dynamically or from words which do not have a stack effect, you must enable this flag, because in these situations the C type lookup is not folded away and the global table must be consulted at runtime." } ;

HELP: deploy-math?
{ $description "Deploy flag. If set, the deployed image will contain support for " { $link ratio } " and " { $link complex } " types."
$nl
"On by default. Often the programmer will use rationals without realizing it. A small amount of space can be saved by stripping these features out, but some code may require changes to work properly." } ;

HELP: deploy-compiler?
{ $description "Deploy flag. If set, words in the deployed image will be compiled with the optimizing compiler when possible."
$nl
"On by default. Most programs should be compiled, not only for performance but because features which depend on the C library interface only function after compilation." } ;
