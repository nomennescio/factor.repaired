Congratulations, you are now running your very own Wiki.

You can now click *Edit* below and begin editing the content of the [[Front Page]]. This Wiki uses [[Farkup]] to mark up text.

Two special article names are recognized by the Wiki: [[Sidebar]] and [[Footer]]. They do not exist by default, but if you create them, they will be visible on every page.
