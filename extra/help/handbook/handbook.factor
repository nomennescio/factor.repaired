"Factor documentation consists of two distinct bodies of text. There is a hierarchy of articles, much like this one, and there is word documentation. Help articles reference word documentation, and vice versa, but not every documented word is referenced from some help article."

"Some generic words have " { $strong "Description" } " headings, and others have " { $strong "Contract" } " headings. A distinction is made between words which are not intended to be extended with user-defined methods, and those that are."
{ $heading "Vocabulary naming conventions" }
"A vocabulary name ending in " { $snippet ".private" } " contains words which are either implementation detail, unsafe, or both. For example, the " { $snippet "sequence.private" } " vocabulary contains words which access sequence elements without bounds checking (" { $link "sequences-unsafe" } ")."
