"A " { $emphasis "presentation" } " is a graphical view of an object which is directly linked to the object in some way. The help article links you see in the documentation browser are presentations; and if you " { $link see } " a word in the UI listener, all words in the definition will themselves be presentations."
$nl
"When you move the mouse over a presentation, it is highlighted with a rectangular border and a short summary of the object being presented is shown in the status bar (the summary is produced using the " { $link summary } " word)."
$nl
"Clicking a presentation with the left mouse button invokes a default operation, which usually views the object in some way. For example, clicking a presentation of a word jumps to the word definition in the " { $link "ui-browser" } "."

"Clicking and holding the right mouse button on a presentation displays a popup menu listing available operations."

ARTICLE: "ui-inspector" "UI inspector"
"The graphical inspector builds on the terminal inspector (see " { $link "inspector" } ") and provides in-place editing of slot values."

"To display an object in the UI inspector, use the " { $link inspect } " word from the UI listener, or right-click a presentation and choose " { $strong "Inspect" } " from the menu that appears."

"When the UI inspector is running, all of the terminal inspector words are available, such as " { $link &at } " and " { $link &put } ". Changing slot values using terminal inspector words automatically updates the UI inspector display."

"Slots can also be edited graphically. Clicking the ellipsis to the left of the slot's textual representation displays a slot editor gadget. A text representation of the object can be edited in the slot editor. The parser is used to turn the text representation back into an object.

"If you install " { $strong "Factor.app" } " in your " { $strong "Applications" } " folder, then other applications will be able to call Factor via the System Services feature.
