"The " { $vocab-link "delegate" } " vocabulary implements run-time consultation for method dispatch."

"Fundamental to the concept of " { $emphasis "protocols" } ", which are groups of tuple slot accessors, or groups of arbtirary generic words."
$nl
"This allows an object to implement a certain protocol by passing the method calls to another object."
$nl
"Unlike " { $link "tuple-subclassing" } ", which expresses " { $emphasis "is-a" } " relationships by statically including the methods and slots of the superclass in all subclasses, consultation forwards generic word calls to another distinct object."
$nl
"Fundamentally, a protocol is a word which has a method for " { $link group-words } ". One type of protocol is a tuple, which consists of the slot accessors. To define a protocol as a set of words, use"
