ARTICLE: "growable" "Resizable sequence implementation"
"Resizable sequences are implementing by having a wrapper object hold a reference to an underlying sequence, together with a fill pointer indicating how many elements of the underlying sequence are occupied. When the fill pointer exceeds the underlying sequence capacity, the underlying sequence grows."
$nl
"There is a resizable sequence mixin:"
{ $subsection growable }
"This mixin implements the sequence protocol by assuming the object has two specific slots:"
{ $list
    { { $snippet "length" } " - the fill pointer (number of occupied elements in the underlying storage)" }
    { { $snippet "underlying" } " - the underlying storage" }
}
"The underlying sequence must implement a generic word:"
{ $subsection resize }
{ $link "vectors" } ", " { $link "byte-vectors" } " and " { $link "sbufs" } " are implemented using the resizable sequence facility." ;

{ $description "If " { $snippet "n" } " is less than the length of the sequence, does nothing. Otherwise, if " { $snippet "n" } " also exceeds the capacity of the underlying storage, the underlying storage is grown, and the fill pointer is reset. Finally, if " { $snippet "n" } " is greater than or equal to the length but less than the capacity of the underlying storage, the fill pointer is moved and nothing else is done."
